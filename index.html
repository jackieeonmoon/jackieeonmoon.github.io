        <p>
        ratties are generally found in the sewer by the river or dead in fatal traps.
        <p>
        before you threw out their bodies, have you wondered what their lives was- their feelings of love, fear, orgasm, and death.
        <p>
        in this rat-manitarian project, i have the honor of interviewing in detail with hundreds of thousands of rats- some liberated from the cold prison of human hatred, some came to me crying with bruises covering their bodies, others simply thought their voices are as valid as some stupid presidents or tv drama or body positivity cults.
        the realities and images you will be seeing might be mildly-to-extremely unsettling.

        BUT YOUR CONSCIENCE ORDERS YOU TO READ ON.

      this rat needs to be cuddled because it was bullied by the colored rat gang- saying it is too gray. gray rat was very upset and decided to bury its feelings with cuffs and spikes. the spikes make the rats in the gray colony think it was morally inferior for very arbituary reasons. rat was deeply hurt and could feel the spikes turning inside its little body. ;
